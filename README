1. About
========

A freehand drawing tool.
Input: pointer device (e.g. mouse) events.
Output: graphic vector path (lines and splines) which a GUI toolkit renders.
Not a complete app, only a component.
Includes a rudimentary GUI app for testing.
Written in pure Python.

Tags:
- freehand drawing.
- computational geometry.
- incremental (dynamic) line tracing.
- Python coroutines.
- pipe of filters.
- GUI toolkit Qt.

Derived from potrace by Peter Selinger.

See much more technical discussion in the code.


2. Version 2.0
==============

PolySegment, Segment, ControlPoint classes.
Explicitly model the abstractions of a polyline.
This more cleanly separates freehandTool from what it produces.
Demonstrates editing a PolySegment by manipulation of its ControlPoints.
(Although editing is not graphical, just crude demo via keystrokes.)


3. Plans for Version 3.0
========================

- Relations between ControlPoints defines behavior of manipulations.
- An API that can be cleanly hooked to a GUI editor.
