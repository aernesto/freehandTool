1. About
========

A freehand drawing tool.
Where a tool is a user interface object, something a user uses.
A freehand drawing tool is a component of a vector graphics drawing app.

Input: pointer device (e.g. mouse) events, from the app
Output: graphic vector path (lines and splines) which the app (via a GUI toolkit) renders.

Includes a rudimentary GUI app for testing (draw with LMB, distort with key or Ctl-key)

Written in pure Python.
Emphasis on domain objects and class/responsibility/collaboration documentation.

2. Version 0.0.2
================

SegmentString, Segment, ControlPoint classes.
Explicitly model the abstractions of a SegmentString.
This more cleanly separates freehandTool from what it produces.
Demonstrates editing a SegmentString by manipulation of its ControlPoints.
(Although editing is not graphical, just crude demo via keystrokes.)


3. Version 0.0.3
================

- Relations between ControlPoints defines actions (behavior of user manipulations.)
- Cusps known by SegmentString 
- Actions defined as a Strategy/Policy
- An API that can be cleanly hooked to a GUI editor.


4. Serialize/Deserialize
========================
TODO
Calculate cuspness geometrically.
Cuspness is not currently serializable/deserializable, only exists just after SegmentString creation.


5. Directory structure and distribution
=======================================
The top directory freehandTool includes a demo app, freehandApp.py.
It also include other distribution artifacts e.g. setup.py.

The directory freehandTool.freehandTool is the main Python package of the tool.
In that package, freehand.py is the main program for the tool.
Also in the package are pointerEvent.py and ghostLine, glue between the tool and the app.

The directory freehandTool.freehandTool.generator is a Python package that the tool calls (the low-level implementation.)

The Python distribution (a zipped archive) includes only the package freehandTool.freehandTool and subpackages,
but not the demo app.

6. The demo app
===============

Draw with the mouse left button down.
Any key modifies an arbitrary control point (the second one?)
A key with control key also down modifies said control point while maintaining cuspness.

A real app would have an alternate user interface for editing (dragging?) control points.

7.  Installing
==============

If you clone the git repository, you can change directory to the project directory and simply execute freehandApp.py.

It is not useful to install as a Python package in the standard place, 
unless you have written your own app that uses the freehand tool.  
In that case, the setup.py scripts are in the project.
You should produce a distribution archive (>python setup.py sdist),
copy and upack the archive somewhere else,
cd to that directory,
and install it (>python setup.py install).
(The archive in the repository at dist/freehandTool-0.1.tar.gz
is only the tool and not the demo app,
and the archive may not be up to date.)
