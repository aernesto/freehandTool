Version 0.0.2
=============

SegmentString, Segment, ControlPoint classes.
Explicitly model the abstractions of a SegmentString.
This more cleanly separates freehandTool from what it produces.
Demonstrates editing a SegmentString by manipulation of its ControlPoints.
(Although editing is not graphical, just crude demo via keystrokes.)


Version 0.0.3
=============

- Relations between ControlPoints defines actions (behavior of user manipulations.)
- Cusps known by SegmentString 
- Actions defined as a Strategy/Policy
- An API that can be cleanly hooked to a GUI editor.

Version 0.1
===========

A production version?

Add exception for generated null segments, catch the exception internally, and handle it gracefully.
I don't expect the algorithm to generate null segments, but if it does they are handled.

Improve ghosting of the head of the generated curve: path instead of straight line.

Clarify use of input, view (int pixel) coords and internal, scene (float) coords.
Eliminate rounding errors by not converting in the back direction.

Reraise StopIteration.  If the tool fails, it will generate this exception.
A caller might be able to rescue.

Remove all print statements.

Version 0.2
===========

Convert to Python3 compatible code.
Convert to PyQt5. To undo, replace PyQt5->PyQt4 and QtWidgets->QtGui.

Version 0.3
===========
Eliminate import logging for production code.
Eliminate import __future__
